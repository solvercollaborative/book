Create a python program named count_XE_tags.py that counts the instances of XE tag in an input file.

The input print book file we will be working with is "../mybooks/superArchItelligence Vol1 8x10.docx". 
I will call it input_file for short.

The input-file has 402 instances of XE tag.
One way to recognize an XE tag is by doing a case-sensitive search for 'XE "'.

Create a unit test case that verifies the resulting count is equal to 402.

Output the results of the program and the test case.
