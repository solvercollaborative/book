Create a python program named convert_XE_tags.py that reads and input file and converts each instance of XE tag to a point bookmark.

The input print book file we will be working with is "../mybooks/superArchItelligence Vol1 8x10.docm". 
I will call it input_file for short.

The output e-book file we will be creating is "../mybooks/superArchItelligence Vol1 e-book.docm". 
I will call it output_file for short.

The input-file has 402 instances of XE tag.
We have tested code that counts XE tags, so we don't need to count them.

We also have tested code that counts point bookmarks. 
There is 1 point bookmark in the input_file.

Count the point bookmarks after the conversion.
Create a unit test case that verifies the resulting count is equal to 403.

Output the results of the program and the test case.
